As for the process, I just skipped through the video using the table of contents in order to watch the topics I didn't know about.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> 10:00AM 2/21 </td><td> 12:00PM 2/21 </td><td> <a href=  "https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Photoshop-Designers-Designing-Grids-Guides/614293-2.html">Lynda Video on Using Grids and Guides in Photoshop CC 2018</a> </td><td> This part of my curriculum took longer than I estimated in my original post, as I followed along in my own instance of Photoshop as the video progressed taking the time to edit my instance's default options and parameters for grids and guides. Since most of the textures/tilesets in the map-making community have adopted a 1"x1" standard for their image dimensions, I set up my grid and guiding systems to work under that assumption. These changes were very useful for the practice two posts below.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> 11:00PM 2/21 </td><td> 01:30AM 2/22 </td><td> Surfed the internet forming a library of textures/tilesets/objects/tokens/and player/NPC portraits. </td><td> This wasn't necessarily time spent in Photoshop so I am a little reluctant to include it here, but figured it was an important enough part of the process to list. Most of the textures/tilesets were found through simple Google Images searches, but I was lucky enough to stumble upon some Google Drive uploads of libraries which I was able to copy. I now have a 20GB folder sitting on my HDD waiting to be used.  </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 10:00PM 2/22 </td><td> 01:00AM 2/23 </td><td> Practiced by making my own maps for my upcoming Dungeons and Dragons game on 2/25 (posted below) </td><td> I was more laid-back when making these maps than when I was focused on the Lynda videos as this is ultimately a creative outlet for me which I like to do to relieve stress, so the time spent here might be a little misleading as I wasn't furiously working on the maps the entire time. I may have also been watching a documentary on the Roman Emperor Vaspasian in the background throughout the process. Taking the time to set up the guides/grids for my Photoshop installation ended up being a great and saved me a lot of time in the alignment process (This cannot be understated). I have yet to practice any of the lighting / blending / compositing effects, so this should at least provide for a good baseline to be compared against my future progress. </td></tr>

Skipped over the table of contents in this video quite a bit, but spent a lot of time watching the sections on blending, opacity, color correction, and lighting </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 06:00PM 3/02 </td><td> 08:00PM 3/02 </td><td> <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Design-tutorials/Photoshop-Texturing-Shading-Techniques/597016-2.html"> Lynda Video on Shading </a> </td><td> A useful video for shading, though the parts which were related to 3D shading were not too applicable.   </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 02:00PM 3/07 </td><td> 04:00PM 3/07 </td><td> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOLIOhuWF87JEd3cpgmnaYdHQakfp57oa"> Youtube playlist tutorial on making battlemaps in photoshop </a> </td><td> When I was initally looking up materials/tutorials for this curriculum and was skipping through this video, the video maker was rather hard to follow. Now that I have a bit more time under my belt it was definitely much easier to follow. I'm actually very impressed with how condensed the author was able to make these videos, even if there were a few times I had to play over the same parts over and over again to make sure I was following along correctly </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 10:00PM 3/07 </td><td> 12:00AM 3/08 </td><td> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3O26kkDcNqU7sM0pgR_XktW0BLtmVMIR" > Youtube playlist tutorial on making battlemaps and setting maps</a> </td><td> These videos were much less condensed/scripted than the previous tutorial, but were still generally pretty helpful. The author was using what looked to be an older photoshop version, but I was suprised with how consintent the UI has seemed to stay the same, I didn't really have any major problems translating the skills over to CC2018. The author in this video makes his map through a lot more manual drawing than what I have been doing (using tiles/textures) so it was definitely a nice experience. I am by no means an artist so it was good to practice actually drawing. </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 11:00AM 3/09 </td><td> 01:00PM 3/09 </td><td> <a href="https://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?t=27077"> The forum post which began my interest in making my own battlemaps </a> </td><td> This tutorial/guide is MUCH more specific than the video tutorials I have been watching, in that it focuses not on general map-making techniques but rather walks you through building a speific map. As a result it can provide much more low-level information, such as specific opacity values and pixel-level editing. It reaffirmed a lot of the methods I have learned so far, and validates a lot of what I've been working with. </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 09:00PM 3/11 </td><td> 12:00AM 3/12 </td><td> Practiced making more maps </td><td> For my last couple hours I practiced by making a couple more maps which will be posted below. While creating these maps I focused specifically on lighting and shading techniques. Since beginning this curriculum I have become much more competent with Photoshop as a software. </td></tr>
