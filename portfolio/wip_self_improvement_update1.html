            For most of the past week I've been busy studying for my CS1674 Intro to Computer Vision midterm so I haven't had as much
            time as I would have liked to put into my self-directed study, but below I've listed those things I've been able to accomplish
            and work on. Mainly I've just been working on the fundamentals, learning the basic tools and UI's, and trying my best to piece 
            together what maps I can.

              Below are images of a couple of maps I've been able to make using Photoshop. They're pretty basic, in creating them I didn't employ
              many more techniques than just downloading texture tilesets, cropping/subsampling them to uniform dimensions, and stitching them
              together. I did learn how to use Photoshop's 'guide' and 'grid' systems however, which were a huge help.
