              /*
              For my Self-Guided Skills Development I want to focus on improving my Photoshop skills. To be more specific, I want to
              improve my ability to make maps for tabletop RPG's using Photoshop. I am aware that this might seem a pretty frivolous
              goal, but I truly do think that a lot of image processing / compositing / post-production skills can be learned and applied to this task.
              I am an avid fan of roleplaying games, and love to play with my friends even if we cannot meet up in person. There are web
              platforms with chat rooms which allow for players to share screens and maps, and so I would like to improve the quality of
              the maps I share with and use to play with my freinds. I expect to learn a lot about texturing, color editing, lighting, shading,
              layer compositing, reslution matching (I will be using a lot of assets from different sources, balancing their resolutions is something
              I want to know how to do), grid overlays, and just other general tips and tricks.

              - Lynda Tutorial about the essential basics of Photoshop CC 2018. I’m already familiar with most of the things in this video
              , but I would like to learn more about the blend tools and different brush options. At the very least it will give me a 
              brief rundown of the UI and all the different tools available. <br>
              Estimated Time: 1 Hour. <br><br>

              2. <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Photoshop-CC-2018-One-One-Fundamentals/633852-2.html">Link</a><br>
              - Lynda tutorial about Photoshop CC 2018 fundamentals. A lot of the sections in this video seem to be things I already know 
              (I’m familiar with how to zoom-in and switch image windows) and other things seem irrelevant to my goal, but the sections on 
              texture resolutions, lighting, blending, opacity, and color adjustment seem like good things for me to know.<br>
              Estimated Time: 3 Hours.<br><br>
              
              3. <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Photoshop-Designers-Designing-Grids-Guides/614293-2.html">Link</a><br>
              - Lynda tutorial about displaying/drawing grids and using guides to ensure straight lines.  Due to the fact that most 
              tabletop RPG’s are played on a grid-based system, this seems like a necessity for me to learn.<br>
              Estimated Time: 1 Hour<br><br>
              
              4. <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Photoshop-Designers-Textures/622069-2.html">Link</a><br>
              - Lynda tutorial about creating/applying textures to your image. These skills can be very useful for adding 
              “faded parchment” effects to the world maps I want to create or by applying dirt textures to oft-travelled roads. Due to 
              maps being comprised of mainly tilesets, textures are the main way to add variance to your maps.<br>
              Estimated Time: 2 Hours<br><br>
              
              5. <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Design-tutorials/Photoshop-Texturing-Shading-Techniques/597016-2.html">Link</a><br>
              - Lynda Tutorial which goes more in-depth into texturing and shading. <br>
              Estimated Time: 2 Hours<br><br>
              
              6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOLIOhuWF87JEd3cpgmnaYdHQakfp57oa">Link</a><br>
              - Youtube playlist about making DnD battlemaps in Photoshop. The actual videos are rather short but I intend to follow 
              along with them for the most part So I expect it to take me more time than just sitting there and watching<br>
              Estimated Time: 2 Hours<br><br>
              
              7. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4l18pPD4zrALq_3lAfJuDg/playlists">Link</a><br>  
              - Another set of Youtube playlists detailing how to make battlemaps in photoshop. Also plan to work alongside these videos
              so I expect it to take me some time.<br>
              Estimated Time: 2 Hours<br><br>
              
              8. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3O26kkDcNqU7sM0pgR_XktW0BLtmVMIR">Link</a><br>
              - Another set of youtube playlists detailing how to make maps in photoshop. These videos seem much less concise than the 
              others, so I’ll probably just be browsing them to pick up on any tricks which haven’t been covered in the earlier 
              material.<br>
              Estimated Time: 2 Hours<br><br>
              
              9. <a href="https://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?t=27077">Link</a><br>
              - A fantastic forum post with a chain of useful comments about how to create maps for tabletop games. This is the forum 
              post which originally got me interested in making maps for photoshop. I am aware that the Photoshop version used in this 
              post is not CC 2018, but the basic theories of layering, opacity, masking, brush texturing, etc should all carry over.<br>
              Estimated Time: 2 Hours<br><br>

              - Lynda tutorial which goes into lighting. This is all post-production so I don’t want to worry about it until I 
              understand everything else, for that reason I intend to learn these techniques last.<br>
              Estimated Time: 3 Hours<br><br>
                
              Here are some examples of maps I have found by others:<br><br>
