      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>The author of this blog is Randyll Bearer, who was at the time of this writing a Senior Computer Science student at<br> 
      the University of Pittsburgh. One cold, December day in 2017 he decided to start a blog chronicling his attempts at<br> 
      learning new programming languages, using new software, and tackling new problems and challenges in order to prepare<br> 
      himself for the post-graduation job hunt.<br><br>
      This blog will contain summaries of the projects that the author has embarked on, be they in voice recognition, Python<br> 
      scripting, or even taking stabs at virtual reality applications. Randyllâ€™s perpetual goal for this blog is to complete<br> 
      and post a summary of at least one project per month, as he firmly believes that there is always something new to learn.<br> 
      The author hopes that this blog will provide informative yet informal glimpses into the constantly evolving field that<br> 
      is Computer Science.</p>
