              /*<br>
              This was written as a sort of mission statement for this website, a quick rundown of what sort of design principles I wanted
              to focus on when designing it. <br>
              */<br><br><br><br>
              
               If I had to condense my design preferences for my website into a single word, it would be “Minimal”. 
               I am most engaged in a website when I am able to think of what I want (e.g. navigate to a new page or interact with a web element) 
               and then be able to do exactly that with as little wasted time as possible. The act of interacting is what keeps me engaged 
               in a website, so I want to design my website in such a way as to allow for maximum interactivity. To accomplish this, 
               I intend to make my website as “Minimal” as possible.<br><br>
              
              To me, “Minimal” in a web design context implies clean menus and a lack of cluttering graphics. Others may find the prevalence of 
              white space boring, but I would like to use surrounding whitespace to give my content emphasis and make it stand out. This is 
              because if my content is standing out, then it will be easier for the human eye to find and therefore easier for 
              users to interact with.<br><br>
              
              I suppose that what this says about me as a writer/designer is that I value results over traditional aesthetics, and that I am 
              placing the importance of my own content over the importance of the user’s viewing pleasure. Intrinsically this paints me, the author,
              as self-absorbed. But on the other hand, the audience for my personal website will be whomever is interested in my personal content in the first place, 
              so I reckon it is fine to make my content the focal point of my design.<br><br>

              So to accomplish this “Minimal” design, I intend to use fixed menus (so that there is less time wasted scrolling), a 
              contrasting color palette (so that it is easier to find desired elements), and no distracting logos/images.
