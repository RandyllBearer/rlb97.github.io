	            I’ve lived the majority of my adult life possessing only a passing familiarity with the sorcery that is HTML and CSS. I 
              knew the rough basics of DIVs, spans, and ‘p’ tags. I had studied the arcane box-model in my inquisitive youth, and had 
              learned the importance of floating rather than flying through long nights of trial and error. But every hacked-together 
              CSS file only left me all the more keenly aware of just how much more I had to learn. Somewhere out there, I knew, in 
              those oft-rumoured-about secluded cubicles in the far-off reaches of the Silicon Valley, resided those wizards of HTML and
              CSS who truly knew their craft. Who could arrange three paragraphs and an image all on the same line, and who could manually 
              implement parallax during their coffee breaks. Even having gone through the trials and tribulations of developing this site 
              (as admittedly humble as it is) I would not be ready to count myself among their number, though perhaps they would accept me 
              as an apprentice.<br><br>
              
	            For I learned a lot more than I thought I would when I began implementing this website. I struck the earth having no 
              intentions of doing anything fancy or including any overly-complex widgets, in fact I intended to make it rather “minimal”,
              you know just something <a href="https://youtu.be/yKgBhxWMTGM?t=105">simple and clean</a> (see Writing Sample: Week 4 for
              more), and I expected to be able to complete the whole thing in a couple of hours. But in 
              Computer Science there are known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns, and unfortunately for me I came across a whole lot more of
              the latter. I knew that making a fixed sidebar menu would be a little more difficult than simply implementing a <a href> 
              tag, I estimated it to take me fifteen minutes (it took ten). I did not know that trying to center a DIV inside another 
              DIV and not have the backgrounds overlap would take roughly two-and-a-half hours (I estimated one minute).<br><br>
              
	            And while I always knew and was aware that “minimal” did not necessarily equal “simple”, designing and implementing this 
              website really drove that point home. My goals and objectives with this site were pretty humble, be easy to use and place 
              emphasis on the content, but in just those two concepts alone there was a whole lot to think about and break down. In 
              terms of color pallete what temperature did I want to go for? Well I wanted this blog to be mainly relaxed and informal 
              so I went with cool color choices. How would I place emphasis on the content? Well I decided to to use a dark background 
              color and varied text box colors to have the contrast make my content “pop”. What could I do to make my website more 
              interactive? Well I ended up making my links respond to hovering and and thus provide additional feedback. What could I do
              to make my website easier and faster to use? Well I implemented a fixed sidebar menu which reduces the need for scrolling 
              to find links. To implement any of these things required me to go spelunking through the depths of Stack Overflow and 
              W3Schools where I was able to learn a great deal.<br><br>
              
	            I’ve approached each of these assignments so far under the pretense of writing a blog about my learning experiences in 
              the field of Computer Science (as detailed in the About Me section) with an emphasis on being informal yet informative. 
              To keep up with this “tech” theme I’ve tried to do little things like include code comments on each of my submissions, 
              make my favicon a linux terminal, and try to write my prose and include references for the intended audience of the 
              technologically-savvy. If I were to expand upon this theme further I would try to style my sidebar menu so that it looks 
              like a Linux folder directory, but that is currently beyond the CSS skills in my posession.<br><br>
              
	            Going forward there are quite a few things related to web development which I would like to further learn:<br><br>

              -  First and foremost is that I would like to learn at least a little bit of JQuery/JavaScript. The amount of 
              functionality/flexibility that they provide is just too useful to ignore. I’m assuming that to create my folder directory 
              sidebar I will need to use at least a little bit of dynamic programming.<br><br>

-             - I would also like to learn how to better arrange images on a website, maybe look at some popular container DIV layouts 
              for content organizing.<br><br>

-             - Lastly I would like to learn about some unintuitive/quirky tendencies of the human psyche, and how better to subtly 
              influence viewers. Like what color I should predominantly use for each emotion, that sort of thing.
