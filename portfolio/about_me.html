                The author of this blog is Randyll Bearer, who was at the time of this writing a Senior Computer Science student at 
                the University of Pittsburgh. As part of his curriculum for his last semester before graduating, Randyll took the course
                ENGCMP0610: Composing Digital Media instructed by Professor Matthew Lavin. The course was centered around learning how to 
                compose a range of critical media objects using HTML, Audacity, Photoshop, and learning how to apply design principles
                to those projects.
              
                This blog will act as the online portfolio repository for that class, a showcase of Randyll's digital media creations. 
                The author's perpeptual goal for this blog is to complete and post a summary of each in-class assignment and/or project
                as they are completed. Hopefully this blog will provide some insight into the author's motivations and/or ideas while
                creating these projects.
