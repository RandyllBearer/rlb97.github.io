              Below is a mock craigslist posting we students were tasked to create in Week 1's lecture. I had just watched the 2017-2018 
              NCAA championship the night before so a certain inaccurate kicker was still fresh in my mind. I have nothing against this kicker
              personally, I just had no other ideas at the time of being tasked to write it.

               For Sale: Slightly Used Kicker<br><br>
 
               Dimensions: 40 yards x 25 feet to the left.<br><br>
 
              Like New though admittedly of questionable craftsmanship. Works perfectly fine under typical operating parameters ( <20 yards) but you might risk it cracking under pressure from any deeper.  Comes from a great pedigree. Has Championship experience, but willing to let it go for low bids!<br><br>
