               <br><br><b>1. An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience.</b><br><br>
                For this first section of my Final Portfolio, I wanted to present my adverts created for Week 6 and revised for
                Work in Progress 2. Below is the original advert:
              
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/ad 0.jpg" width="100%" alt="Original">
                <br><br>
              
                And the following is the result of my first revision I did in class:
              
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/advert edited.png" width="100%" alt="Edited">
                <br><br>
                
                As you can see, I primarily only initally made one change in moving the graphic to center stage. I did this because
                I feel that most advertisements these days do not care about the technical specifics as much as they do presenting
                the user/potential customer with a display of pathos. No contemporary car commercials are describing turn radius or
                torque, rather they are trying to show how cool one is when driving the car. With this edit, I wanted to emphasize how
                happy/content the customer will be with their purchase by placing the graphic in the center of the Gutenberg Diagram.
                
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/ad revised.png" width="100%" alt="Revised">
                <br><br>
              
                The above is my second revision of the advert. In it, I wanted to rebrand the slogan in order to evoke a nostalgic/retro
                feel and vibe as well as the contemporary era seems to be one composed of nostalgia.
                Graphics hardware is in heavy demand at the moment due to its usefulness in crypto-mining, so I wanted
                to appeal to that audience and potential customer base as well. 
                
              
               <br><br><b>2. An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode.</b><br><br>
              
                I do not belive I have a better example of visual revision than the changes I have made to my own website. For
                reference, below is a screenshot of my original website design:
              
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/Screenshot of Old Website.png" width="100%" alt="Original">
                <br><br>
              
                And for reference is a screenshot of my current design as of this writing:
              
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/screenshot of new website.png" width="100%" alt="New">
                <br><br>
              
                Ever since dropping the "Computer Scientist Blog" angle and going for one more personal, I decided to change my
                color scheme from a more subtly subdued to a more stylisticly explicit one. I unabashedly modelled it after the
                yet-to-be-officially-released Youtube Dark Theme (Please Google make it official soon). I've always preferred
                dark themes as they are easier on the eyes and as someone who spends a not-so-insignificant amount of time
                behind a computer screen it makes life much more comfortable. 
              
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/youtube dark theme.png" width="100%" alt="Youtube">
                <br><br>
              
                While I was changing my color scheme I also wanted to fix a couple of design flaws with my original scheme, namely
                contrast. The sidebar text in my initial website design was a very light color on a not-so-dark background, making
                it difficult to read on most monitors. In my new dark theme it was much easier to pick a contrasting color as the
                majority of my colors are, well, dark black, and almost everything contrasts well with black. I also changed the design
                of the scrollbars on my website (except the .pdf scrollbars as I do not know how to change those) in order to create
                a more cohesive design.
              
               <br><br><b>3. An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another.</b><br><br>
              
                I believe my logo designs for Borders provide good examples of comparison between old and new. The prompt for this
                assignment was to revise the logo of a defunct company for the modern age, and the logo I chose (Borders) was a bit
                of an odd pick for this assignment as the Borders logo was very ahead of its time in the first place (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zmgE1mqAeuPFm3Uq8TVDQninIX4n4Bts1jqg6Rl3lEM">Link</a>
                to my presentation where I talk about this more indepth in the "Notes" section). Basically to summarize, Borders
                was founded in a time where other companies wanted to appeal to an earlier aesthetic, but Borders, as a purveyor
                of the newest music, the newest books, and the newest movies, wanted to appear to be as modern as possible. This is
                evident from their original logo design which strays heavily from other older logos such as The Hard Rock Cafe for example.
              
                <br><br>
                <img src="./images/Borders Logo.png" width="100%" alt="My Logo Designs">
                <br><br>
              
                When comparing the old Borders logo (The topmost one in the above image) to other more modern logos I predominately noticed two
                things. One, the old logo, as a long horizontal rectange, is not well suited to mobile devices. Two, the logo lacks the "In the know"
                capacity of other modern logos such as Fed-Ex (Inverted Arrow), Google (Breaks the The Primary Colors), and Amazon (Delivers everything
                from A to Z). To solve the first issue I designed four potential mobile logos (square icons) for Borders. To solve the second, I made
                one of the corners of the Borders logo to be a book/laptop which breaks the boundaries of the box. This works on both a "Think outside
                the box level" and a "Our technology will let you break boundaries" level.

               <br><br><b>5. An example of something you are particularly proud of.</b><br><br>
