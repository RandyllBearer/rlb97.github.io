            For most of the past week I've been busy studying for my CS1674 Intro to Computer Vision midterm so I haven't had as much
            time as I would have liked to put into my self-directed study, but below I've listed those things I've been able to accomplish
            and work on. Mainly I've just been working on the fundamentals, learning the basic tools and UI's, and trying my best to piece 
            together what maps I can.

As for the process, I just skipped through the video using the table of contents in order to watch the topics I didn't know about.</td></tr>

Since most of the textures/tilesets in the map-making community have adopted a 1"x1" standard for their image dimensions, I set up my grid and guiding systems to work under that assumption. These changes were very useful for the practice two posts below.</td></tr>

Most of the textures/tilesets were found through simple Google Images searches, but I was lucky enough to stumble upon some Google Drive uploads of libraries which I was able to copy. I now have a 20GB folder sitting on my HDD waiting to be used.  </td></tr>

I may have also been watching a documentary on the Roman Emperor Vaspasian in the background throughout the process. Taking the time to set up the guides/grids for my Photoshop installation ended up being a great and saved me a lot of time in the alignment process (This cannot be understated). I have yet to practice any of the lighting / blending / compositing effects, so this should at least provide for a good baseline to be compared against my future progress. </td></tr>

              Below are images of a couple of maps I've been able to make using Photoshop. They're pretty basic, in creating them I didn't employ
              many more techniques than just downloading texture tilesets, cropping/subsampling them to uniform dimensions, and stitching them
              together. I did learn how to use Photoshop's 'guide' and 'grid' systems however, which were a huge help. These maps should be a good baseline
              to compare to my future progress where I will hopefully be able to employ more advanced techniques.
