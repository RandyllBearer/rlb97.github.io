                The author of this blog is Randyll Bearer, who was at the time of this writing a Senior Computer Science student at 
                the University of Pittsburgh. One cold, December day in 2017 he decided to start a blog chronicling his attempts at 
                learning new programming languages, using new software, and tackling new problems and challenges in order to prepare 
                himself for the post-graduation job hunt. He might've included some various writing samples along the way.<br><br>
              
                This blog will contain summaries of the projects that the author has embarked on, be they in voice recognition, Python 
                scripting, or even taking stabs at virtual reality applications. Randyllâ€™s perpetual goal for this blog is to complete 
                and post a summary of at least one project per month, as he firmly believes that there is always something new to learn. 
                The author hopes that this blog will provide informative yet informal glimpses into the constantly evolving field that 
                is Computer Science.
